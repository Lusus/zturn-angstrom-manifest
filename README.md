zturn-angstrom-manifest
=======================

Quick hack Ångström Repo manifest repository, for zturn board. See https://github.com/Angstrom-distribution/angstrom-manifest for original.

These are the setup scripts for the Ångström buildsystem. If you want to (re)build packages or images for Ångström, this is the thing to use.
The Ångström buildsystem is using various components from the Yocto Project, most importantly the Openembedded buildsystem, the bitbake task executor and various application and BSP layers.

To configure the scripts and download the build metadata, do:

	$ mkdir ~/bin
	$ PATH=~/bin:$PATH

	$ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
	$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Please note that repo requires python2, some distributions which default to python3 might need below fix

	sed -i "s%/usr/bin/env python$%/usr/bin/env python2%" ~/bin/repo

you might have to re-run this command everytime repo tool is updated in ~/bin/repo

Run repo init to bring down the latest version of Repo with all its most recent bug fixes. You must specify a URL for the manifest, which specifies where the various repositories included in the Android source will be placed within your working directory.

	$ repo init -u git://github.com/Lusus/zturn-angstrom-manifest -b default

When prompted, configure Repo with your real name and email address.

A successful initialization will end with a message stating that Repo is initialized in your working directory. Your client directory should now contain a .repo directory where files such as the manifest will be kept.

To pull down the metadata layers to your working directory from the repositories as specified in the default manifest, run

	$ repo sync

When downloading from behind a proxy (which is common in some corporate environments), it might be necessary to explicitly specify the proxy that is then used by repo:

	$ export HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy_user_id>:<proxy_password>@<proxy_server>:<proxy_port>
	$ export HTTPS_PROXY=http://<proxy_user_id>:<proxy_password>@<proxy_server>:<proxy_port>

More rarely, Linux clients experience connectivity issues, getting stuck in the middle of downloads (typically during "Receiving objects"). It has been reported that tweaking the settings of the TCP/IP stack and using non-parallel commands can improve the situation. You need root access to modify the TCP setting:

	$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling=0
	$ repo sync -j1

Setup Environment and building
------------------------------
	$ . ./setup-environment
	Select zturn-zynq7 from the menu

Now a image can be built:

	$ MACHINE=<machine> bitbake <image>
	e.g. MACHINE=zturn-zynq7 bitbake zturn-image

(I usually get away with simply:)
	$ bitbake zturn-image

Deploying to SD-card
--------------------
To create a bootable SD-card, first repartition and format a SD-card, with a small (say 64 MB) FAT primary partition, followed by a EXT4 partition.

To populate the FAT partition, copy the files to which the symlinks listed below point to (all located in the deploy/glibc/images directory) to the FAT partition:
boot.bin => boot.bin
u-boot.img => u-boot.img
uImage => uImage
uImage-zynq-zturn.dtb => devicetree.dtb

Copy the desired bitstream to the FAT partition, and rename to system.bit.bin 

To populate the filesystem, sudo untar the Angstrom-zturn-image-glibc-ipk-v2016.12-zturn-zynq7.rootfs.tar.gz archive to the second EXT4 partition.

Booting up
----------
Simply supply power to the board, via 5V or USB_UART.

Use a serial communication application (eg kermit) to connect to the USB serial device created when USB_UART gets enumarated, at 115200 baud. This link may be useful: http://denx.de/wiki/view/DULG/SystemSetup

Login as root without a password.

Tweaks
------
Look at layers/meta-zturn (after repo checked everything out) for all the custom recipes for the zturn, especially the README.md file.
